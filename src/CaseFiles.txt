The victim, Dr. Foo, was found dead in the bushes outside the mansion.
An autopsy has not yet been performed, but it appears that the victim was
murdered last night and dragged outside. At the night of the murder, there
were six other guests present in the home.

   Suspect Name:       Age:     Hair Color:
1. Ms. Scarlett        24       Blond

5. Mrs. Peacock        38       Red
6. Professor Plum      32       Light Brown

The mansion was huge, though, and where in the house the crime was committed
is currently unclear, but investigators are looking for clues as we speak.
There are ten whole rooms to search, so this will take some time.

Detectives found 6 different objects that seemed to be in strange locations,
all of which could have been used to kill.

   Object           Details
1. Rope             Looks like it had been stretched quite a lot over the years. That, or maybe it happened recently...
2. Wrench           One of those heavy-duty metal ones. Is that dried blood I see, or is it rust?
3. Candlestick      Looks like it had recently been alit.
4. Revolver         Pretty self explanatory.
5. Knife            Looks pretty clean, but it's always possible it had been washed.
6. Pipe             It's clearly still wet. Where it came from is unknown.

We assigned detective Jill and her assistant Jack with the task of solving
this case with the information gathered.
